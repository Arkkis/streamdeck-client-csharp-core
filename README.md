# streamdeck-client-csharp-core

A C# client library built with .NET 8 for the Elgato Stream Deck device.

## What is this?

It's simply a .NET 8 conversion of [this streamdeck-client-csharp library](https://github.com/TyrenDe/streamdeck-client-csharp) which I converted to use latest .NET versions + AOT compile support.

## Requirements

This library is only tested on Windows 11.

## Current functionality

The library should support all features documented by the SDK:

- Connection and Disconnection
- Sending messages
- Receiving events

## How do I get started using it?

[Original repository](https://github.com/TyrenDe/streamdeck-client-csharp#how-do-i-get-started-using-it) provides great instructions how to use it.

## I found a bug, who do I contact?

Just head over to the https://github.com/Arkkis/streamdeck-client-csharp-core/issues page and create a new issue.
